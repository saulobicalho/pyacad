https://pythonacademy.com.br/blog/desenvolvimento-web-com-python-e-django-model obs: after inserting data test (Marcos) on shell, it isn't returning the
desired entry (it says Funcionario isnt defined) -->problem solved. When doing the query on shell, as described at the example, it is still necessary to
provide the first line as that one of the funcionario creation (from pyacad.models import Funcionario)

This is the correct query, on py shell:

from pyacad.models import Funcionario

query

OBS: if its a query that make some alteration on the model, its necessary to do a .save(), at the end

https://pythonacademy.com.br/blog/desenvolvimento-web-com-python-e-django-view it is still a little difficult to apply the use of 2 urls.py files. It is
not properly understood which code should be used on the urls.py of website app.

path('funcionarios/<int:ano>/', views.funcionarios_por_ano)  --> where do this code should enter on the project? Should it be inside the square brackets
of url patterns, on website>urls.py ?
At this moment, it is being tested to use it at this place (mentioned above)
